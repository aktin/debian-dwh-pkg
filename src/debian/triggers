# Trigger handling for WildFly updates from i2b2 package
#
# These triggers ensure DWH components survive WildFly updates by:
# 1. Backing up the DWH application (EAR) and configuration before WildFly update
# 2. Restoring and reconfiguring them after the update
#
# The backup trigger runs before i2b2 package removes the old WildFly
# The restore trigger runs after i2b2 package configures the new WildFly
